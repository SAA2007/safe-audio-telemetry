# Project S.A.F.E. (Store-And-Forward Encrypted) Audio

## Overview
Project S.A.F.E. is an **educational, consent-based audio telemetry system** designed to help students and early-career security engineers learn about **fault tolerance, encryption, and resilient system design**.

The system follows a **store-and-forward model**, allowing audio data collected on **user-owned or explicitly consenting devices** to be safely queued and transmitted when network connectivity becomes available.

## Intended Use
This project is intended for:
- Learning secure telemetry and reliability patterns
- Experimentation on **devices owned by the user**
- Use with **explicit, informed consent** from all participants
- Educational and research purposes only

## Project Status
**Early development / active design.**  
Architecture, features, and implementation details are subject to change.  
This project is **not production-ready**.

## Design Principles
- Reliability over performance
- Explicit user consent for all data capture
- Data ownership remains with the device owner
- Graceful handling of network failures

## Non-Goals
This project is **not** designed for:
- Covert or stealth recording
- Surveillance of individuals or groups
- Monitoring without visible indication
- Commercial analytics, tracking, or data collection

## Documentation
- Development roadmap: `ROADMAP.md`
- Ethical constraints and boundaries: `ETHICS.md`
- Licensing terms: `LICENSE`
